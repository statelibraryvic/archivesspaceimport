# ArchivesSpace importer

This program is quite specific to our needs but it gives an example of using the API to add/update agents & archival objects

## Installation

Clone the repository & create a settings.php file in the base directory. A sample can be found at settings.php.template

## Usage

php import.php <csv file> <object>

Where object can be **archival_object** or **agent_object**. Example data sets of both agents & archival objects can be found in the repository
